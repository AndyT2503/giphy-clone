# GiphyClone

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.12.

Based on your requirement, I create Gipy-Clone. This app will show Trending GIFs, GIF's detail. Because I can not find api search trending GIF when researching on [Giphy Developers Document](https://developers.giphy.com/), search function will search all GIF in Giphy, not only Trending GIF, if you pass null value to searching input, I will return Trending Page. 

If you cannot get Gif Info when launching this app, please go to [Giphy Create App](https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/?create=true) to get new api_key and change the key in environment.ts

I spend 9 hours completing this project. I'm a covid-19 patient when I coded this project, so I think I can do it better if I'm fine.
